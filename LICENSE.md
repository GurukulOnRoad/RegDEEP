This license grants reference rights only. It does not grant ownership, reproduction, redistribution, or derivative rights.

**Institutional Use:** Institutional, corporate, training-provider, or LMS deployment of repository content requires a formal written licensing agreement with GurukulOnRoad.

## 3. Prohibited Use
Without prior written permission from GurukulOnRoad, the following are strictly prohibited:

a) Commercial reuse or resale of repository content

b) Repackaging content into paid or monetized products

c) Redistribution of repository content in modified or unmodified form

i) Corporate training deployment using repository datasets

j) Creation of derivative works based substantially on repository datasets or reasoning architecture

These restrictions apply regardless of format (digital, print, LMS, API, dataset, AI training data, or other medium).

## 4. No Derivative Assessment Replication
The assessment logic, trap design structures, reasoning density models, classification sequencing, and regulatory interpretation architecture contained in this repository are proprietary intellectual constructs. Replication, adaptation, reverse engineering, structural imitation, or functional equivalence recreation for commercial or institutional deployment is not permitted.

## 5. No Official Affiliation
This repository is an independent educational infrastructure.

It is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or formally connected to any regulatory authority including (but not limited to): SEBI, RBI, IRDAI, PFRDA, FINRA, SEC, CII (UK), CISI, or any other regulatory body. All regulatory authority remains exclusively with the respective issuing institutions.

## 6. No Advisory Relationship
This repository provides structured educational interpretation of publicly available regulatory material. It does not constitute legal, financial, investment, insurance, compliance, or professional advice. Users must consult official regulatory publications for authoritative guidance before making academic, professional, or operational decisions.

## 7. Commercial Products & Deployment Layers
Certain structured learning systems and commercial products built using the RegDEEP™ framework are distributed exclusively via official GurukulOnRoad platforms.

Commercial Entry Point: [https://learn.gurukulonroad.com/s/store](https://learn.gurukulonroad.com/s/store)

Public Good Digital Asset Library: [https://learn.gurukulonroad.com/products](https://learn.gurukulonroad.com/products)

This repository functions as the structural backbone and does not grant rights to reproduce, replicate, or redistribute commercial systems.

## 8. AI & Automated Use Restriction
Repository content may not be used for:

a) Training artificial intelligence models,

b) Fine-tuning machine learning systems,

c) Dataset aggregation,

d) Knowledge graph ingestion or semantic/LLM ingestion for commercial systems,and

e) Automated scraping for derivative product creation, 

without prior written permission from GurukulOnRoad.

**Special Provision:** For AI training, machine learning ingestion, or structured data integration, authorised clean JSON datasets may be made available under separate licensing agreements. Please contact GurukulOnRoad for authorised access.

## 9. Trademark Protection
“RegDEEP™”, “RegDEEPMCQ™”, “RankSeparator™”, “QuantIntent™”, and “Policy IntentSignal™” are proprietary identifiers of GurukulOnRoad.

This license does not grant permission to use these marks in product naming, branding, marketing, institutional documentation, or commercial deployment without prior written consent.

## 10. No Certification or Endorsement
Use of repository material does not create certification status, endorsement, partnership, accreditation, or affiliation with GurukulOnRoad unless formally documented through written agreement.

## 11. Attribution Requirement
When referencing the framework, citation must include:
