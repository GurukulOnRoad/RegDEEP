# RegDEEP™ - Regulatory Decoding & Exam-Oriented Knowledge Infrastructure (Global + India)
RegDEEP™ (Regulatory Decoding &amp; Explanation for Exam Purpose) - Is a Regulatory Decoding &amp; Exam-Oriented Knowledge Infrastructure (Global + India), with structured regulatory decoding datasets and examiner-aligned knowledge mappings supporting BFSI exam preparation, circular interpretation, and regulatory reasoning development. 

## 🔶 Overview
RegDEEP™ (Regulatory Decoding & Explanation for Exam Purpose) is an examiner-aligned regulatory reasoning framework developed by GurukulAI Thought Lab.
This repository serves as the structured dataset layer of the RegDEEP™ ecosystem.

**It contains:**

✅ Regulatory mapping tables

✅ Comparative framework matrices

✅ Exam-aligned decoding structures

✅ Circular interpretation datasets

✅ Concept differentiation maps

✅ Assessment architecture blueprints

✅ Regulatory intent classification models

🟣 **NOTE:** This repository is designed as utility-first regulatory infrastructure, not as a coaching substitute or question bank.

## 🔶 Purpose of This Repository

**This repository exists to:**

🎯 Structure complex regulatory material into machine-readable and human-readable frameworks

🎯 Support examiner-aligned assessment design

🎯 Maintain structured datasets used across RegDEEP™ learning pages

🎯 Enable expansion into micro-learning and corporate capability frameworks

🎯 Maintain version-controlled regulatory mappings

### Design Principles:
👉🏻 Framework-oriented

👉🏻 Exam-aligned

👉🏻 Version-controlled

## 🔶 What This Repository Is

✅ A structured regulatory mapping system

✅ A dataset backbone for RegDEEP™ learning architecture

✅ A reference layer supporting NISM Series 2026

✅ A circular decoding structure library

✅ A regulatory intent classification model

✅ Expandable for micro-learning and corporate content

## 🔶 What This Repository Is Not

❌ Not a syllabus

❌ Not a mock test bank

❌ Not a reinterpretation of regulatory law

❌ Not official documentation or claim of affiliation or association with any regulators

❌ Not a shortcut preparation tool

🟣 **All legally binding authority remains with respective regulators.**

## 🔶 Primary Active Layers

### 🔹 Layer 1: RegDEEP™ NISM Series 2026 
The NISM Series 2026 segment represents the most structured and fully deployed implementation of RegDEEP™.

**It applies the framework to:**

✅ Official NISM curriculum

✅ Test objectives

✅ Regulatory provisions

✅ Investment restrictions

✅ Taxation logic

✅ Governance norms

✅ Circular-based interpretation

#### Datasets under this segment support:

1️⃣ RegDEEPMCQ™

2️⃣ AssessmentIntent™ (R-AI™)

3️⃣ RankSeparator™ Mastery Assessments (R-MAT™)

4️⃣ QuantIntent™ Numerical & Calculation (R-QI™) 

5️⃣ Circular decoding content

🟣 **This section remains prominently structured as the currently active deployment layer.**

### 🔹 Layer 2: RegDEEP™ Circular Decoding Layer (Active Layer 2 - Open Access Knowledge Layer)
The Circular Decoding Layer represents the structured regulatory interpretation engine within the RegDEEP™ ecosystem. This layer focuses on decoding official regulatory circulars and policy documents issued by Indian and global regulators into exam-aligned, industry-relevant structured notes.

It operates as a **free public-access layer**, designed to improve regulatory clarity, professional awareness, and exam readiness without functioning as a paid assessment product.
#### Scope of This Layer
This layer applies the RegDEEP™ framework to:

✅ Regulatory circulars and updates

✅ Policy notifications

✅ Master circulars

✅ Regulatory amendments

✅ Compliance advisories

✅ Implementation directives

**Across regulators including (but not limited to):** SEBI, RBI, IRDAI, III, PFRDA, FINRA, SEC, CII (UK), CISI, including other Global Regulators.
#### Structured Outputs Within This Layer
Each decoded circular may include:

🎯 Exam-specific micro learning notes

🎯 Concept differentiation maps

🎯 Regulatory intent breakdown

🎯 Industry applicability notes

🎯 SOP-aligned implementation summaries

🎯 Compliance flowcharts

🎯 Priority signal extraction

🎯 Version-based change comparison

🎯 Downloadable structured PDF reference (where applicable)

🟣 **The goal is structured clarity, not reinterpretation.**

#### Application Areas
This layer supports:

👉🏻 NISM, CAIIB, JAIIB, III, IRDAI, FINRA, CII exam preparation

👉🏻 BFSI compliance professionals

👉🏻 Risk & governance teams

👉🏻 BPO / KPO / GCC domain teams

👉🏻 Instructional designers

👉🏻 Corporate regulatory capability development

🟣 **It bridges exam cognition and operational implementation.**

#### How This Layer Differs from the Layer 1 NISM Series 2026 Layer
Unlike the NISM Series 2026 segment, which is assessment-architecture-driven, this layer is:

✅ Interpretation-driven

✅ Policy-focused

✅ Circular-centric

✅ Industry-applicable

✅ Open-access

**It does not provide:**

❌ Paid mock test content

❌ Full assessment simulations

❌ RankSeparator™ exam modules

**Instead, it functions as a regulatory clarity layer feeding both:**

1️⃣ Exam preparation

2️⃣ Industry understanding

#### Framework Integration in Layer 2
Circular decoding under this layer may apply:

✅ RegDEEP™ core reasoning lens

✅ Policy IntentSignal™ extraction

✅ Concept Recognition mapping

✅ Concept Differentiation classification

✅ Application & Judgment scenarios

**This ensures consistency of reasoning across:**

🟣 Free decoding content

🟣 Commercial assessment layers

🟣 Corporate adaptation models

#### Output Format Philosophy Layer 2
All decoded circulars follow:

✅ Source-bound structure

✅ No alteration of legal meaning

✅ Clear differentiation between summary and interpretation

✅ Explicit disclaimer of legal authority

✅ Version tracking

**Where flowcharts or SOP diagrams are included, they are:**

✅ Illustrative

✅ Educational

✅ Non-binding

✅ Implementation-supportive

❌ Does not constitute financial, legal, investment, insurance or professional advice. 

#### Limitation & Advisory Notice (Layer 2 - Circular Decoding)
The content provided within this Circular Decoding Layer is intended solely for educational, academic, and professional learning purposes. It represents structured, exam-aligned interpretation of publicly available regulatory circulars and policy documents. It does not constitute financial, legal, investment, insurance, compliance, or professional advisory services. Nothing contained in this layer should be relied upon as a substitute for official regulatory publications, statutory interpretation, or professional advice. Readers and professionals are advised to consult the original circulars, notifications, master directions, and official publications issued by the respective regulatory authorities for authoritative guidance, compliance decisions, and operational implementation. **All regulatory authority remains exclusively with the issuing body.**

#### Position Within RegDEEP™ Ecosystem

🟧 **RegDEEP™ NISM Series 2026** → Assessment-driven, commercially deployed layer

🟧 **RegDEEP™ Circular Decoding Layer** → Open-access regulatory clarity and micro-learning layer

🟣 **Both operate under the same reasoning architecture, but serve different purposes.**

#### Intended Outcome of Layer 2
A reader using this layer should be able to:

🎯 Understand the regulatory intent behind the circular

🎯 Identify exam-relevant implications

🎯 Recognize operational impact

🎯 Translate regulatory language into structured understanding

🎯 Avoid misinterpretation under exam or compliance pressure

#### Governance Layer 2

✅ Circulars are decoded based on publicly available regulator publications

✅ Updates are version-tracked

✅ Regulatory authority remains with issuing body

✅ Educational interpretation does not replace official compliance guidance

#### Long-Term Role of Layer 2
This layer serves as:

✅ The regulatory interpretation engine

✅ A micro-learning content feeder

✅ A compliance awareness bridge

✅ A foundation for future structured data packs

✅ A contributor to corporate capability development

🟣 **It remains open-access while aligned to the RegDEEP™ reasoning philosophy.**
