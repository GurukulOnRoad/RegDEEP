      "description": "RegDEEP™ NISM Exam Prep Series 2026 is a focused, examiner-aligned preparation series designed exclusively for NISM certification examinations. The series applies the RegDEEP™ (Regulatory Decoding & Explanation for Exam Purpose) framework to transform official NISM curricula, test objectives, and regulatory material into exam-ready understanding and defensible decision-making ability. Each title in the series trains candidates to recognize concepts accurately, differentiate near-identical provisions, and apply correct regulatory logic under ambiguity -reflecting how NISM exams are actually constructed and evaluated. This series is intended for serious learners seeking clarity, elimination skill, and consistency under exam pressure, rather than rote memorization or shortcut-based preparation.",
